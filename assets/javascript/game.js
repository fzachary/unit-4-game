    // Reset the corresponding HTML for *player's score* in the DOM
    // Generate a *target number* (VARIABLE) that the user is supposed to reach. The user must reach this number exactly. If they go over, they lose. Use Math.random to select a random number between 19 and 120.
    // Console.log this number to check if working
    // Generate a random number for each of the crystal images (divs) that will add to the *player's score* when clicked. ***This will require 4 variables.***

    // *ON CLICK EVENT FUNCTIONS*
    // FUNCTION: When user clicks on images, add the assigned amount of points from each to the *player's score* variable + update the HTML with the current *player's score*
    // COMPARE FUNCTION: If the *player's score* is below the *target number* do nothing but continue to run the game function
    // If the *player's score* is above the *target number* then it is a loss. Add 1 to the *loss counter* variable. Update this in the DOM and RESET() the game (keeping the new *win counter*)
    // If the *player's score* is equal to the *target number* then it is a win. Add 1 to the *win counter* variable. Update this in the DOM and RESET() the game (keeping the new *win counter*)
